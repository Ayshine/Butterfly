# Data
I recently published my Butterfly macro photos to Kaggle platform. For this repo the dataset I used the the very same data which you can download here:

- [Kaggle/Ayshine/Butterfly](https://www.kaggle.com/ayshine/butterfly)

# Installation

The working environment saved as `butterfly.txt` In order to run the code with the same installation use the command below to create a new conda environment.

~~~
conda env create --file butterfly.yaml
~~~


All the code is on  "Butterfly_Pytorch.ipynb" file.

*Readme will be updated after reviewing code*
*what is to be added?*
*Detailed environment setup to run the project*
*Result Comparision*

*Happy Coding...*
